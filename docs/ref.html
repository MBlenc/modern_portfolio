<p>The issue as to whether consciousness or qualia exist and if so, what form they take is often talked about as though it were an intractable problem, as it is ‘ineffable’ <span class="citation">(Dennett, 1988)</span>. But as <span class="citation">Churchland (1996)</span> explains, that is probably just because we do not know enough about it yet. It is also likely because there is an extent to which consciousness is only visible from “within the standpoint of a conscious subject” <span class="citation">(Žižek, 2006, p. 178)</span>. This makes it hard for us to see its <em>use</em>, we are so immersed and invested in it that we are tempted to view it as an intrinsic property of the universe <span class="citation">(you could look at the anthropic principle outlined by Carter, 1974 for example)</span>. This could be true, and there is probably a valuable avenue of inquiry there, but on my reading it is more likely that consciousness is functional, evolutionarily adaptive, and possibly more specific to the kind of life-form that we are than we would like to admit.</p>
<p>Taking the view that consciousness is functionally necessary, then a ‘zombie’ that could behave as we do would <em>have</em> to be conscious to be indistinguishable from a ‘conscious’ human. The scenario is making a claim about our conceptual ability rather than a logical claim. <span class="citation">Metzinger (2003)</span> describes the problem in this way: &quot;logical possibility (or necessity) is not implied by phenomenal possibility (or necessity).&quot;<span class="citation">(Metzinger, 2003, p. 55)</span>. In other words, just because we are able to conceive a scenario, it does not mean that it is <em>possible</em> or even coherent. Given this, the following describes a possible mechanistic explanation of consciousness.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Graziano &amp; Webb (2015)</span> explain consciousness in the following terms: we have a part of our brain that is essentially an “attention attribution mechanism”. This is easier to think of as it relates to others’ attention. Human beings (and other animals) attribute attentional states to people, animals, and sometimes even moving geometric shapes <span class="citation">(Heider &amp; Simmel, 1944 offer a great example of this)</span>. This has a clear evolutionary advantage for animals as social as we are. According to this theory, we use a similar mechanism to determine our own attentional state; we are aware of our attentional state (we have a meta-understanding of attention). This awareness of our attentional state is likely, according to this model, what we experience as qualia. The appeal of this theory is in that it accounts for subjectivity simply, mechanistically and in a way that makes evolutionary sense.</p>
<p>How does this apply in the zombie case? We could say that the zombie would not appear to be sufficiently indistinguishable from a human being ‘with qualia’ if it lacked the ability to detect attention in others. We could turn one half of the mechanism off - the part of the system that attributes attention to ones’ self. This causes a problem as well though, as we are able to determine and communicate our own attentional state to one-another, and the zombie would conspicuously lack this ability. This model does however have problems if there are conscious states that exist in the absence of attention <span class="citation">(For example see Metzinger, 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Given this plausible mechanistic account, and its application to the ‘zombie’ scenario, let’s dig a bit deeper into some reasons to seriously consider the implications of the ‘zombie’ scenario. <span class="citation">Chalmers (1996)</span> uses the scenario to lead us to the conclusion that once we account for the entirety of the physical universe, there necessarily a lot ‘left over’, unaccounted for. He would classify the model mentioned above as falling under the ambit of the ‘easy’ problem of consciousness <span class="citation">(Chalmers, 2010)</span>. Why is this phenomenon accompanied by <em>experience</em>? The short answer is that whatever experience looks like from the inside, if we examine its component parts they will not satisfactorily explain the ‘feeling’ of the phenomena. Chalmers is making an argument here about the way that we should approach researching these questions. For him approaches that focus purely on the physical processes that give rise to conscious phenomena miss part of the story.</p>
<p>Chalmers thinks that we should approach the study experience as though it were a fundamental law of the universe and flirts with pan-psychism (the idea that consciousness (or experience) exists to varying degrees in everything) <span class="citation">(Chalmers, 1996)</span>. This perspective requires a very different set of metaphysical presumptions and methods of inquiry from those that cognitive science currently preferences. I’ve found that the following left-of-center example helps to clarify the benefits of such an approach. <span class="citation">Bednarik (2011)</span> investigates similar ideas, but rather than in the field of modern neuroscience, in that of archaeology. He argues that when we are looking through archaeological evidence for markers that indicate the emergence of modern humans, most researchers take the wrong approach in looking at bones and tools. Bednarik argues that archaeologists should instead see art as the principle marker of the emergence of modern humans as it gives us the most direct insight into the internal states of early humans, in his view it is ‘more direct’. He sees looking at skeletons to determine the point at which modern humans emerged as being akin to using phrenology to determine a person’s psychology and argues that tools are used by many non-human animals and have ambiguous uses. In other words, these could easily be the tools or skulls of ancient ‘zombies’. Art, on the other hand, shows us what these people were seeing and that they were forming mental representations similar to our own. This is indicative of what we are liable to miss when searching for an understanding of human experience from a purely physical, functionalist perspective.</p>
<p>So, is the idea of a ‘zombie’ coherent? For zombies to exist it would need to be determined that qualitative conscious experience has no <em>functional</em> value. As we learn more about the mind by manipulating facets of experience and showing the functional operation of the systems involved in human perception and cognition we are ever expanding our understanding of the abilities and limitations of these systems, giving us glimpses into the machinery behind human experience. However, I can’t get behind Dennett’s rejection of qualia outright. I’d rather “generously persist in refusing to believe that philosophers can be making a fuss about such a narrow and fantastical division of opinion” <span class="citation">(Dennett, 2001, p. 235)</span>. While taking into account the concerns of philosophers and lay-peoples’ investment in qualia, it seems to me worthwhile to consider the possibility that embracing functionalism might offer us one of the most promising avenues for investigating potential mechanisms behind consciousness.</p>
